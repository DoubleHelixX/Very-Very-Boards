# Very-Very-Boards
Open Via Visual Studio  

About: My first School project that was done using Visual Studio for my CST 4708 - Software Development and the .NET Framework class.  

What is it: The program is taken from one of the problems in the textbook "Advanced Visual Basic 2010" Fourth Edition; titled Very Very Boards.  

Relevant Features: Visual Basic and Gifs.  

Description: Very very boards rents snowboards during the snow season. A person can rent a snowboard with or without boots. create a project that will calculate and display the information for each rental. In addition, calculate the summary information for each day's rentals. for each rental, input the person's name, the driver's license or ID number, the number of snowboards with boots. snowboards without boots rent for $20; snowboard with boots rent for $30. Calculate and display the charges for snowboards and snowboards with boots, and rental total. In addition, maintain summary totals. Use constants for the snowboard rental rate and the snowboard with boots rental rate. Create a summary frame with boxes to indicate the day's totals for the number of snowboards and snowboards with boots rented, total charges, and average charge per customer. Include buttons for calculating order, clear, clear all, print, and exit. the clear all command should clear the summary totals to begin a new day's summary. make your buttons easy to use for keyboard entry. Make the calculate button the accept button and the clear button the cancel button.
